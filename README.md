Color Visualizer
What makes this project a point of prestiege is that it is what came to mind immediately after learning about color a few days 
into Java Script... best practices aside.
How many people have had similar revelations at that point in their educations.

Ignore the comments lol

This is a 1st run at showing all of the rgb color combinaitons in 1 go. Here I just go up and down each track and comination
for r g and b for 0 to 255.

16581375 or 16.5 million total cominations actually exist. How many developers have actually seen them all.
at 1 second, 16.5 million seconds = 4605 hours
in milliseconds that's 4.6 hours

Not sure if you can go lower than this,the values can be input but it still runs the same, but would there even be a point. 
Is viewing at that speed even possible at that point.

the goal was to get it down to 4.6 minutes
but functionally one would just break up viewing sessions to specific regions or color and have controls to realistically capture 
the values by slowing down the processes.
